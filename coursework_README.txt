# Instructions

The commands listed in the generateData.bat file were those used in order to generate 
the various reports analysed

The new_settings folder contains all the new settings created to run the different 
scenarios investigated

Within the data folder there is a js script file that was used to convert the map files 
from CSV to WKT as well as separate the tracks from the main roads. This script was also used
to revert from WKT back to CSV. 

The new maps are contained within two folders, EPSG:27700 and kepler the EPSG:27700 files
were those converted to EPSG:27700 coordinate system for use within the simulator while the 
kepler files where in the EPSG:4326 format for use in the kepler visualization tool.

Several of the java files have been modified for this project and the diffs can be viewed at the
